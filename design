* Start aug2cmds with:
  * -r root directory
  * -o puppet|augsrun|augtool
  * -l Sudoers.lns
  * -y "yes", take best guesses
  * /path/to/file (/etc/sudoers or etc/sudoers)
  * [ aug path inside file ]
* First parse PATH with lens if given
* If no augpath given, give the user a `print` type layout and make them select
* For augpath,
  * if -y then use . as the path expression or first child if no .
    * need to consider for the top mode whether it's a seq etc
  * else prompt the user for one or more options to be used in combination
  * if there's no . value and there are children, no need to save the node
  * save the node data
  * recurse into augpath
* Output formatting
  * aug_srun/augtool
  * Puppet
  * API calls
